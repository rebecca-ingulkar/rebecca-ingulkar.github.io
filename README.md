# Hello World!
Welcome to my Dev Academy Blog site. This site will be used to store my blogs about what I learning durning my time of study at Dev Academy. 

## About me
I'm Rebecca. 
I grew up in a small town just outside of Palmerston North, New Zealand. I now live in Wellington, NZ but I'm still a small town girl at heart. 

I decided to study this year to pivot my career to something that I enjoy and something that will allow my family to achieve our goals in life. 

### Why Dev Academy? :emoji:

A few years ago, I signed up and paid for a subscription for Codecademy. I enrolled in their full-stack career pathway and I began studying all things full-stack. The course began with HTML and CSS - both languages that I enjoy. Then, we quickly moved into learning about JavaScript. It was a complete 180 flip from the simple HTML/CSS learning I had completed in the months prior. 

JavaScript stumped me. I quickly became confused and unsure how to help myself learn. I reached out to a family member who had studied Python and he was able to explain it a few JavaScript methods to me, but I was still confused. I needed help from someone who could explain it to me in a way that made sense to me! 

I had heard of Dev Academy through the grapevine and decided that it may be best to learn JavaScript through a course that had facilitators that would be available to ask to bother for questions. And that's exactly what I did.
