      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My goal following completion of this course is to move into a software
        development or web development role. I'm aware that I may not be able to
        find a role suitable for a jr dev at my current workplace. I will be on
        the hunt for a jr dev role in the private sector, most likely at a bank.
        <br />
        <br />
        My long term career goal is to find a suitable job that pays me well
        enough to work part time. My husband and I are hoping to grow our family
        in the next few years and having the ability to work part time or
        remotely is attractive and will allow me to spend more time at home
        taking care of our family.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold"> Limitations:</span> I have a hard time
        staying focused on what I am working on. I need silence to be able to
        comprende what I'm reading. I'm able to listen to music/podcasts if I
        know alot about what I'm working on, but other than those very specific
        times - <span style="font-style: italic">silence is paramount. </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm a perfectionist and a procastinator. I procatinate because I want
        things to be perfect. During the creation of our blog I spent to much
        time working on how it looked rather than how it worked. During this
        study year, I will do my best to keep to the time box limits to ensure
        I'm not rabbit-holing or obsessing over one thing to make my website
        perfect. I know that if I have any spare time at the end of the sprint,
        I can spend extra time that to make my website better.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Strengths:</span>

        I have a good memory for information when it's being done over and over
        and the more I work on something, the better I remember it.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm a morning person. I enjoy waking up early on my study days, making
        my coffee and breakfast and sitting down to do my study. I feel as
        though I can get alot done in the morning. My brain is fresh and I can
        easily get into the zone of working.
        <br />
        <br />
        It reads as though my strengths and limitations contradict each other.
        To put it simply, I like silence most of the time & I'm at my best in
        the morning.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I consider myself as very awkward and a shy person until I know someone
        well. I have a lot to say but I don't like to bother anyone. I'm a big
        overthinker.
        <br />
        <br />
        I would love to strengthen my social and communication skills. Speaking
        to people (even people I know well) is hard for me. I often struggle
        with knowing what to say or even what to talk about when having a normal
        conversation with someone.
        <br />
        <br />
        I would love to build on my confidence - this may go hand in hand with
        the social skills mentioned above. I have days and moments where I'm
        lacking confidence to do simple tasks and to develop that skill would be
        awesome.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I take pride in my strong work ethic and I hope to bring this into my
        study at Dev Academy. I'm making a commitment this year to work on the
        course work during my allocated study days. I will manage my time to
        ensure the workload is completed when it needs to be completed.
        <br /><br />
        I stand by the saying "treat everyone how you would like to be treated"
        and I will keep that on the forefront of my mind this year. I aim to
        treat everyone with respect and kindness as we work together on this
        adventure.
        <br /><br />
        When things are starting to get to me I will first take a break, have a
        bite to eat or take a walk outside. If that doesn't help, I will reach
        out to my facilitator or homegroup (depending on the situation).
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm a big fan of Google. I plan on googling when I need help. If I'm
        unable to find my answer there, I will reach out to the help-desk page
        on discord.
      </p>

      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I would really appreciate feedback from the facilitation team. Feedback
        on my work is important. Am I on the right track? Am I doing enough to
        show my skills are improving? <br /><br />
        I have appreciated when the facilitators have been reaching out on
        discord or letting us know they are available to book a catch up with.
        Knowing that our facilitator is available to chat about the course work
        or just a general chin wag is highly appreciated.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I work Monday to Thursday and I have a class on Monday and Wednesday
        nights 6-7pm. I do most of my course work Friday - Sunday and will make
        myself available during these days as needed. On Sundays, I have a drum
        class from 3-5pm but I'm happy to miss it occassionally.
