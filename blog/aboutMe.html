        <p>
          Kia ora, I'm Rebecca. I'm from a small town called Ashhurst but I now
          live in Wellington and have called Wellington home for the past 10
          years.
          <br />

            I value humour, adventure, honesty and peace the most at this stage
            in my life.
          </span>
          I am always on the hunt for my next adventure, whether that is signing
          up for my next run event or putting my hand up to do something
          different in the weekend - anything can be an adventure, it's all
          about mindset.
          <br />
          <br />I decided to study with Dev Academy this year as I'm at a
          crossroads in my career - I could continue being a SDA, which I have
          been doing for five years, or I could upskill and move into a job that
          is interesting and challenges me.
          <br />
          <br />I've always been creative, whether I'm writing a blog about my
          travels or coming up with app ideas, it seems like the path that I'm
          on now will give me the tools I need to meet my creative goals.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of study/work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and
          family - sign me up for a board game night anytime. I spend a good
          chunk of my spare time exercising. I ran my first half marathon last
          year, and I'm hoping to run another later this year. When I'm not
          running or playing Catan, I can be found cooking something delicious
          in the kitchen, or having a laugh on the phone with my mum or simply
          dreaming up my next adventure.
