      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

      <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is having the ability to be aware and control your own emotions and the ability to express your emotions without lashing out. EQ is also the ability to build and handle relationshops respectfully and with empathy.</p>
      <p>Now, I'm sure you're thinking "How do I know if I have good Emotional Intelligence?"
        <br>
        <h2>Ways that EQ is measured:</h2>
        <ul id="eq">
          <li>Self Awareness - having the ability to recognise your own emotional state, your own strengths and weaknesses, the abilty to recognise your own goals, values and knowing what impact your decisions and behaviour has on those around you.</li>
          <li>Self Regulation - this is about being able to control your disruptive emotions. You can sense when you feel angry but instead of lashing out or yelling, you can alter your emotions depending on the situation you are in. </li>
          <li>Social Skill - being able to manage relationships to get on with people in your environment. With social skills you can easily build rapport and trust with those around you. </li>
          <li>Empathy - to consider others feelings and emotions when making your decisions. Empathy is also being able to perceive emotions and the ability to put yourself in someone elses shoes and understanding/eperiencing how they feel</li>
          <li>Motivation - the ability to understand what moticates yourself and being able to put off your short term goals for long-term success as a group.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>What are some ways to grow your Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
        Instead of yelling when you're angry or stressed, you can try to control the emotion by taking a walk, getting some fresh air or breathing excercises - better yet, why not try all at the same time? Take a walk outside and focus on your breath as you walk. If you're feeling sad or overwhelmed, you could pick up that hobby that you have been meaning to get to or help out a stanger to carry their groceries to the car. A little kindness shared with someone you don't know can help you feel a little boost in positivity. <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Being positive is contagious.</span>
      </p>
      <h2>How is Emotional Intel different than Intellectual Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>Intellectual Intelligence measures a persons ability over topics such as logical problem solving, analytical skills, memory and mathmatical skills. Whereas Emotional Intelligence measures a persons ability to build strong effective relationships, recognise and manage their own emotions as well as recognising others emotions and being able to empathise with them.</p>
      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p>Humans are social creatures. We strive to know people and most people like to spend time with others. EQ assists with our ability to be a social creature. Emotional Intelligence assists with building stronger relationships and it assists you to achieve your career and personal goals. Without Emotional Intelligence, it's harder to make friends or understand yourself to work well with others. Failing to have a decent level of EQ can lead to feelings of loneliness, poor communication and hurt feelings. <span style="font-style: italic;">How we interact and respond to others directly impacts our environment.</span>  </p>
