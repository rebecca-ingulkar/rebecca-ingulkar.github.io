            >Te Whare Tapa Whā was developed by Sir Mason Durie in 1984. It's a
            metephor based on the four walls of a wharenui. Each wall represents
            a different dimension of health, we must look after each wall to
            ensure the structure stays strong. If one wall is damaged the whole
            structure is affected.

      <h2>The dimensions of Te Whare Tapa Whā</h2>
      <p>
      <ul class="eq">
        <li>
          <b>Taha Tinana (Physical Well-being)</b>is all about caring for your
          physical body, whether that is with physical activity or eating foods
          the nourish your body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Taha Whānau (Family & Social Well-being) </b>is all about who helps
          you feel you belong and who you choose to share your life with -
          friends, family, work mates or your local community.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Taha Hinengaro (Mental & Emotional Well-being)</b>is about how you
          think, feel and how you communicate. It's all about your mind and your
          heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Well-being)</b>explores the connection to
          your identity, spirituality, values and beliefs - these provide a
          sense of belonging. This can be viewed so differently by an
          individual, spirituality well-being can be having a belief in a higher
          power or it could be a connection to the universe, it's a truly
          personal element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Whenua (Land, Environment, Connection to Place)</b> is sometimes included to acknowledge the role of the natural world. It 
          is all about
          your connection to the land. It includes plants, animals, bodies of
          water, and people. The whenua pillar can also be viewed as the place
          you feel most comfortable in - the place you belong. This is the foundation for the four walls - if you're missing a foundation, the walls have nothing to connect to!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wellbeing plan</h2>
      <p>
        My well-being plan based off the four pillars off Te Whare Tapa Whā is
        detailed below. <br />
        Creating my wellbeing plan was straight forward for me because most of
        these activities are already things that are happening in my life. I
        think the hardest wall to strengthen, based on my activity choice, will
        be journalling each night and walking to the train station while
        conciously being in the moment. <br />
        Journalling at night is a good way to decompress about the day and it
        will allow my future self to look back on I've accomplished or to look
        at hasn't gone right so I can learn from it. <br />
        Walking to the train station while being consiously present might be a
        hard one to begin. It's muscle memory at this stage to chuck on my
        headphones, and play a podcast for my journey to work. My mornings are
        often filled with nervousness about the day ahead and it's easier to
        distract myself with a podcast than think about the day ahead. I plan to
        put my headphones on and not play anything until I get to the station -
        this way I can enjoy the sounds of the world around me, what a way to
        start the day!
