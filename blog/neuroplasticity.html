      <h2>What are the key principles of Neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>
        
        <ul class="eq">
          <li><b>Use it or lose it.</b> The connection that your brain makes when you learn
            something new or practice a skill you already know strengthens the
            connection to that skill. If you stop practicing that skill, the
            connection will fade and practicing that skill at a overtime
            will become harder and you may feel like you need to start from the beginning again.</li>
          <li><b>Repition and practice.</b> Engaging in a practice of a skill repeatedly will 
            strengthen the connection to that skill in your brain which in turn will make learning more effective.</li>
          <li><b>Intensity and Challenge.</b> While learning a new skill it is important to push yourself 
            out of your comfort zome and engage with activities that require effort which will encourage 
            stronger brain connections.</li>
          <li><b>Novelty and complexity.</b> Learning new information or completing new tasks stimulates our brain and 
            develop plasticity that will develop our abiility to be adaptable.</li>
          <li><b>Attention and focus.</b> Ensuring we get ample amount of time of focused attention to learning, the deeper 
            and more significant the changes will be to our brains function.</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you understand the principles of neuroplasticity it enhances
        your learning experience because it can boost your motivation to learn
        and you become aware of your own ability to learn. It also encuourages learning strategies 
        such as spaced repition
        - this is when you study information over time to ensure the information
        is absorbed rather than forcing yourself to view alot of information in
        a small amount of time (which may have the opposite effect). <br/>Additionally, having a grasp on the 
        principles will show you that making mistakes is all
        part of the process, failing is a part of learning and making mistakes actually helps the brain grow. 
        <br><br><b>TLDR;</b> when you can understand how
        neuroplasticity works, you can stay motivated, use smarter science
        backed strategies for learning and take control of the outcome. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The way that I will use the princples of neuroplasticity for my benefit 
        while studying with Dev Academy are as follows:
        I will use spaced repetition to reinforce the course work rather than
        cramming it in where possible. I'll remind myself that any effort to
        improve my skills leads to brain growth, embrace mistakes as they
        happen and learn from them - which will build resilence to future
        struggles. I will continue with my excercise habits as the principles of
        neuroplasticity suggest that regular physical activity helps with brain
        health. & I will continue with my meditation practice daily to assist with
        emotional regulation. 
      </p>

        Ways to increase neuroplasticity: 
        <ul class="eq">
          <li>Stimulate your brain by travelling/exploring a new country 
            or suburb in your town, learning a new language or musical 
            instrument or reading.</li>
          <li>Exercise regularly. Regular physical exercise helps to prevent 
            loss of connections in your brain which are linked to the part of your brain that stores your memory.</li>
          <li>Practicing mindfulness can improve your neuroplasticity. By training your mind to focus on your
            body and allowing your mind to be free from thinking about the past or future, this helps to develop 
            your emotional regulation, memory and <self-awareness></self-awareness>.
          </li>
          <li>Engaging in playing games, whether it's video or board games both can improve neuroplasticity. Games often builds on
            your problem solving skills, strengthening your prefrontal cortex whinh in turn improves your logical thinking. Gaming can strengthen
            the connections to the hippocampus to enhance your memory.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is the belief that your ability and intelligence can and
        will improve overtime with dedication, learning, effort. When you have a growth
        mindset you look at challenges as opportunties for growth and learning,
        you learn from your mistakes and you know that with effort you can
        improve. Growth mindset is relevant because it encourages lifelong
        learning, it increased motivation and resilience and it supports mental
        wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theory of growth mindset vs fixed mindset is something I have learnt
        before. But reasearching the topic for a decent period of time really
        helped me to understand myself a little bit more. I definitley grew up
        with a fixed mindset, I remember in highschool thinking that I wouldn't
        have much of an intellectual future because I didn't get good grades,
        and the thought "I'm either good at it or not" really determined my
        outlook of my future. Thankfully my mindset changed when I started to
        study as an adult and don't get me wrong, I'm still learning and trying
        to lean into the growth mindset side of things. I now know that learning
        doesn't stop once you finish high school, in fact your learning journey
        is only just beginning at that stage. My mindset has changed to "I can get
        better with practice"
      </p>
      <p>
        To me the growth mindset is a mental game. It's all about self talk and
        how that affects me and my journey. I have written some of the words
        from growth mindset images on post-it notes and stuck them to the wall
        near my study space, so if the time comes that I need extra motivation
        to figure our how loops work, I can have a quick glance at the wall to
        shift my focus back to my learning goals and change my self-talk..
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently read a book about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset
        written by David Eagleman, it's called <b>"The Brain: The Story of you"</b>.
        I'm not a big reader, but this book is <i>*chef's kiss*</i>. Super fasinating
        and informative and backed up by science. If you can get a copy from
        your local library it's well worth the read.
