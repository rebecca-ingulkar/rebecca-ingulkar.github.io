      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>
        <ul class="eq">
          <li>I learnt that while growing up I had a fixed mindset with this only transitioning to a growth mindset since becoming an adult. </li>
          <li>It was nice to deep-dive into and explore what I value in life, because I've never really thought about it before. Thinking about what 
            my values are and why they resonate with me was really eye-opening.</li>
          <li>I've learnt that I like to be liked and in the past I have held back my opinion or feedback on things because I don't want to start 
            unnecessary conflict. Now I'm learning to give my opinion or feedback respectfully even when it's uncomfortable - this is how I'll grow </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>I think the role of personal values in learning and programming is important, because your values shape who you are and the values that align your life will align how you learn and how you program. 
        Empathy helps you to be patient with others in your learning environment and helps you recognize that others have their own struggles with learning. Programming with empathy is great for collaboration with colleagues 
        and will help you to understand potential blockers and will help with communication in your work environment.
        Being self-aware is also important in learning and programming because it helps you identify your own strengths and weaknesses. Self-awareness encourages self-reflection and learning from mistakes. </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
        <p>During the listening and looping challenges, I found both roles - listening and speaking - to be challenging. Speaking for two minutes without interruption was uncomfortable. 
          I struggled to focus on the topic and when it was my turn to listen, I wasn't confident in my ability to remember everything accurately. 

          To my surprise, my buddy said I did well in the recalling part of the exercise. 
          They mentioned that I captured what they had said. This feedback made me reflect on how I often underestimate myself, especially in unfamiliar situations. </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h2>
        <p>I think creating my learning plan was tough. It sounded like a simple task but actually sitting down and thinking about how much time I need to commit and when was a bit a struggle. 
          It's all well and good to say 'it's only part time, I'll fit it in' but to really commit to the work and think about my priorities was a different kettle of fish. 
          Setting realistic goals, identifying my time-blockers and committing to the work without becoming too overwhelmed required a decent amount of self-awareness. </p>
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on 
          Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>When I was younger, I thought programming was a solo career where people sit in a dark room for hours on end scrolling through gibberish on a screen - thanks TV.
          <br>
           Now I know that programming is a whole lot more than that. People that work in programming need to have good human skills - they need to be good at communication, empathy doesn't hurt to have and the ability to control your own emotions will help! 

          Imagine working for a programming company and you're building a website for a non-technical client. You'll want to be good at communicating to understand what they want. You will need empathy to ask better questions to build a website that will solve their problem. </p>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? 
          Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>I don't think it's a waste of time. How often do you get set aside time to think about who you are and why you are how you are. Learning about human skills has given me the opportunity to learn about myself and what I need to work on to be a great programmer. </p>
