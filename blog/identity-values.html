        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
        <p id="subtitle">
          This topic was an interesting one for me. As someone who doesn't say
          much, I haven't spent much time thinking about what my values are.
          There were plenty of light bulb moments during the exploration stage
          and I'm happy to share what I found.

      <h2>VIA Survey of Character Strengths</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Humour and playfulness</li>
        <li>Fairness, equity, justice</li>
        <li>Gratitude</li>
        <li>Curiosity and interest in the world</li>
        <li>Honest, authenticity and genuineness</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        From the list above, I see myself very clearly. This strengths test was the first thing I did when starting
        exploring this topic. It opened my eyes and gave me a better prespective on what I value in this life. 
      </p>
      <h2>Gallup Strengths Finder</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Adaptability</li>
        <li>Empathy</li>
        <li>Posivitity</li>
        <li>Developer</li>
        <li>Includer</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        What I found really interesting about the strengths finder test is, I've
        done this test 3 times in the past 10 years and my top five have always
        remained the same, except for one. Developer is a new strength in my
        list. In my most recent test, Developer has replaced Responsibility.

        <q><span style="font-style: italic;">Rebecca is an adventurous, funny, creative, delightful woman. Rebecca is
          determined to achieve what ever she puts her mind to. When she is
          working on problems in her job she endevours to find solutions rather
          than leaving work for collegues. <br>Rebecca prefers working in an
          environment that fosters positive relationships, this is reflected in
          her values of authenticity and humour. Rebecca finds humour a vehicle to
          relax herself and others in social situations, the humour is situational
          and self depreciating. <br>The courage Rebecca shows is evident in being
          willing to try new opportunities and to set goals for herself. In
          situations that are new to her she sets to challenge herself. This is
          evident in the course that she is now enrolled in and entering middle
          distance running events.. <br>Rebecca is creative and will find artistic
          ways to express her creativity with resources she has available. <br>Rebecca thinks deeply with empathy when thinking about
          what is happening around her and in the world. This sometimes leads to
          her not being able to share her opinion in case she offends people, and
          to keep the peace.</span></q> - a testimony from my mother, Kathryn.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        <q><span style="font-style: italic;">I've known Rebecca for 8 years (as a my best friend and now wife) and I
        can honestly say she’s one of the most hardworking and dedicated people
        that I know. No matter what she’s working on, she gives it her true
        effort. Her strong work ethic and punctuality makes her very reliable
        and you can always count on her to show up and get things done. <br>She’s
        smart (and street smart), creative, and a team player, always bringing
        fresh ideas to the table. <br>Even though she can be a little shy at times,
        she has a lighthearted side that makes her so fun to be around. She
        loves to joke around and keep things positive. <br>On top of all that,
        Rebecca is incredibly kind, caring, and accommodating- always going out
        of her way to help others and make sure everyone feels included. Her
        loyalty and support mean the world to those lucky enough to know them.
        <br>Rebecca responds well to positive feedback and support. There are
        moments when she may doubt her judgement, but I know she will benefit
        deeply from exposing herself to new experiences, make more mistakes and
        be fearless.</span></q> - a testimony from my husband, Ninad.

      <p>
        A group of friends and I went to Pak'n Save to pick up some ingredients
        for a youth group bake-off. We went through the self-checkout (this was
        back in the early 2010's, when self-checkout just became popular in
        Palmerston North). In our trolley we had the basic cake ingredients;
        flour, cocoa, icing sugar and a few other out of the box ingredients
        such as lemons. We checked out our items and were about to leave the
        store and I looked down into our trolley and saw a lemon that had not
        been put in our shopping bags. We checked the receipt and realised we
        hadn't paid for the lemons. I knew straight away that I either needed to
        fess up and return it to one of the workers or go back and pay for it.
        My values of honesty and inner-harmony forced me to go back to the
        checkout and pay for the lemon. I could have left the store without
        paying for it but looking back on it, I think taking the lemon without
        paying would have made me feel guilty for a long time. I would have
        spent a long time thinking about it, instead, I made a decision
        that I can stand by.

        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adventure</span> - While I was growing up, my parents would often bundle my
          siblings and I in the car and go on an adventure. I remember once we
          drove to Wellington for a burger. It was a Sunday afternoon, mum wasn't
          sure what was on the menu so they decided to take us to Wellington to
          find a good burger for dinner. On our way to Wellington, my parents
          contacted my aunty and uncle who lived in Wellington and they invited us
          for dinner. We ended up having the most delicious Spaghetti Bolognese.
          After dinner we drove back to our house in Ashhurst. These types of
          adventures were common in our childhood and I believe these activities
          grew my sense and want for adventure. </li><br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Humour</span> - Growing up with parents
          who always found the funny side of things. Family who knew that laughter
          was the best medicine. Family who didn't mind making toilet jokes at the
          dinner table. I have fond memories of sitting around the dinner table
          with my family, all gasping for air as we belly laugh for a few mins,
          sometimes with tears in our eyes. I strive for laughter/humour like
          that. </li><br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Honesty and trustworthiness</span> was a value I learnt early on. I
          learnt that being truthful (even when it's hard) helps to build strong
          relationships.I strive to tell the truth to keep myself accountable and
          to any action I make. </li><br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wisdom</span> - Growing up I've learnt that wisdom
          comes from experience, mistakes and from the people I surround myself
          with. I have learnt the value of listening to others experiences to gain
          different perspectives. </li><br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Peace</span> - My parents are well loved in any
          community they are part of. While growing up in Ashhurst, this was no
          different. They always supported those who needed support, they loved
          those who needed a bit of love, they cared for everyone they knew and
          they never had anything bad to say about anyone. This taught me the
          importance of giving back. Because of them, I've learnt to give back to
          my community and the importance of having a solid community of support.</li>

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, my top five strengths (according to Gallup) are Adaptability, Empathy, 
        Positivity, Developer & Includer.
        <br>
        Adaptability will allow me to stay flexible when facing challenges during the course or if my learning 
        environment changes. If things don't go as planned, I will be able to adjust quickly while I find a 
        new approach.<br>
        My strength of empathy allows me to connect with people, build strong relationships and be 
        supportive in group situations. <br>
        My positivity boosts my resilience in tough times which enables me to keep productive when the 
        course gets tough. I often say "but it's all good, it'll be fine," which is just my way to say, I got this. 
        <br>I thrive on seeing others (and myself) grow knowledge and skills. I'm always on the look out for 
        opportunties for improvement and I enjoy supporting others to do the same. <br>
        I have a desire to include everyone in the task and I don't like anyone feeling like they have 
        been left behind or left out of a conversation. I believe everyone in a group environment should 
        have their voices heard and listened to with intent. 
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of my biggest challenges is time management. I live a busy life with
        work, exercise and family commitments. I'm nervous about how I can fit
        everything in while maintaining a healthy balance. The overwhelming
        pressure of tasks can easily become too much. Although this course is a
        welcomed pressure, it will help me to create strong boundaries and I
        will have to learn to prioritise what is most important.<br><br> Another
        challenge of mine for the year of learning, is the public speaking part
        of the course - something which I'm anxious about. The thought of having
        to speak to others about my work is terrifying. I considered pulling out
        of the course to avoid the speaking in front of others. <br>Instead, I spoke to a friend who studied with 
        Dev Academy a few years ago and they advised the course really helped him get over his fear of public speaking. 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> If he can do it, then so can I. </span><br>
        When I really think about my workplace or my gym life, once I
        became comfortable in these spaces speaking to a group became easier - I just need to give myself the
        time to build confidence in myself and confidence in what I'm talking about. 
        <br>I may have been super nervous for my first home group meeting, I may
        have stumbled my words or forgotten what to say. But I believe that the
        more I do speak publicly (or in this case) over video chat, the more
        comfortable I will become - fingers crossed. And I know, public speaking
        is an important part of my future career, so starting small here may be
        the best way to get over my fear, or at least start to get over it.

        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with

        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        As a Service Desk Analyst, I am constantly met with tension from
        customers when they want their computer fixed <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOW</span> and don't 
        have time to
        allow me to troubleshoot and figure out the best way to resolve the
        issue. During these situations, I use empathy to my advantage. I say
        things such as, <span style="font-style: italic;"> "I understand your frustration"</span> or 
        <span style="font-style: italic;"> "I can see how
        annoying this must be".</span><br> While I could spend my time working through all
        of the basic troubleshooting steps, I ask the customer specific
        questions to do with their issue, such as <span style="font-style: italic;"> "what did you notice before
        Outlook crashed?"</span><br> Asking specific questions ensure I can never assume
        what the issue is and it won't allow any time wasting. <br>As soon as I can
        in a call, I will remote into their device to have a look at the issue.
        It's much easier to look at the issue than have the customer try to
        explain the issue, as they can often miss out important details. <br><br>
        During time of reflection of these situations, I could set time
        expectations earlier in the call if I know what the issue is or if I'm
        unsure, I shouldn't be scared to admit that I'm unsure. Or I could even
        give an explanation of what I'm doing as I'm doing it - this is important when remoted into their device. This will help
        customers know that I am working on their issue rather than just
        clicking random buttons on their laptop.
