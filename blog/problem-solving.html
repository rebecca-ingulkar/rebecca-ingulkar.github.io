      <h2>Blocked by a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        During the JavaScript-Kata challenge, superFlipFlop, I found myself
        being blocked by my choice of brackets in a console.log call. I was
        trying to log the function name with an array as the parameter although
        I had square brackets in the wrong place that was causing the console to
        log "undefined".
        <br />
        It was frustrating at the time because the square brackets and the
        curved brackets look so similar and they are easily gazed over when
        checking code for errors.
        <br />
        I found myself looking at the code, over and over. Reading it out loud -
        even then, I still couldn't find my error. I turned to google, asking it
        why my console.log in logging 'undefined'. I saw something online about
        the bracket format and re-read my code... Duh, my brackets were in the
        wrong place. <br />Lightbulb moment!<br /><br />

      </p>
      <h2>Elegantly solving a problem</h2>
      <p>
        Google defines elegantly as:
        <i>adjective</i>
        - graceful and stylish in appearance or manner.<br />
        <em
          >similar words: stylish, suave, swanky, smart, refined, tasteful.</em
        >
        <br />
        <br />

        During the JavaScript-Kata challenge, I used my ability to read error
        messages and googling to elegantly solve the problems that I was facing.
        I found
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"
          >MDN Web Docs</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp">W3Schools</a> to
        be rather helpful in explaining different JS methods and I found a handy
        youtube channel that has
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R371yaBjb54"
          >beginner JS video tutorials</a
        >. When I wasn't able to find the suitable help through YouTube and
        google, I resulted to asking for help in the discord help desk channel.

      <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          <b>Pseudocode</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <br />The use of Pseudocode is a new technique for me, in the past I
          haven't used Pseudocode to plan out my code. This is something that I
          need to work and remembering to do it, will be my biggest obstacle.<br />
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Trying something</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span><br />
          I'm comfortable trying something in the process of problem-solving. I
          feel like this technique goes hand in hand with using google -
          sometimes I stumble across a method that could be used to solve the
          task and I figure I might as well try it in the hope that it works. I
          know that I can always Ctrl + Z to undo it if it doesn't work!
          <br />
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Rubber ducky method</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span><br />
          Although I don't have a physical rubber ducky, I find that I'm often
          talking out loud to myself while working - either reading out the
          question/task or reading something I have found online. Hearing myself
          say what I'm reading helps me to understand what my eyes and brain are
          trying to comprehend.
          <br />
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Reading error messages</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span><br />
          I've found that error messages are often rather helpful. Most of the
          time, the message tells you which line is incorrect or not working.
          The error messages sometimes will point to the part of the code that
          is incorrect, which I think it a total game changer. Imangine if error
          messages didn't say exactly what was wrong, we'd be stuck on something
          for days! Error messages are annoying and sometimes they are hard to
          read but I'm getting there!
          <br />
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Console.logging</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span><br />
          Another technique that I don't use as much. I find that I struggle
          with what to enter inside the brackets and sometimes where to put the
          <code>console.log()</code> itself - inside or outside the function -
          that is the question. This is a technique that I need to work on!
          <br />
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Googling</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span><br />
          Google is great! As mentioned above, I use Google alot. It's available
          instantly and it's easy to use. The only downside to google is that
          sometimes there are too many results and I have to filter through to
          find exactly what I'm looking for.

          <br />
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Asking your peers for help</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span><br />
          I'm not confident with this one but I would like to be. Over the past
          two sprints, I have enjoyed discussing struggles during the looping
          challenge - this showed me that we are all in the same boat and I
          could ask my peers for help if needed.
          <br />
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Asking coaches for help</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span><br />
          At first I felt embarrased to ask for help on the Discord help desk
          page. But seeing others in the cohort asking similar questions gave me
          the confident to post my own questions. I have come to realise that if
          I have questions or if I'm stuck on something then it's totally
          possible for someone else to be stuck and maybe my question will help
          them too!
          <br />
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Improving your process with reflection</b><br />
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span>
          <span class="fa fa-star"></span><br />
          This is another technique I need to work on. I do enjoy reflecting on
          what I've learnt, but I would like to reflect more about what I can do
          better next time.
          <br />

      <h2>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help.</h2>
      <p>
        During JavaScript-Kata Gradebook challenge. I was stuck on the challenge
        for the entire time box suggested time of four hours. It was such a
        frustrating task. I was reluctant to ask for help because the task
        seemed so simple and I thought that maybe my question was just silly and
        embarrasing. I took a break, away from the screen and got some fresh
        air. On my return, I asked for help in the help desk chat and it turns
        out another cohort member was stuck too! Next time I find myself in the
        same situation, I will ask for help sooner - being stuck on the same
        issue for hours on end is not helpful to anybody (especially yourself.)
