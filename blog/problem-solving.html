      <h2>Blocked by a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        During the JavaScript-Kata challenge, superFlipFlop, I found myself
        being blocked by my choice of brackets in a console.log call. I was
        trying to log the function name although I had square brackets in the
        wrong place that was causing the console to log "undefined".
        <br />
        It was frustrating at the time because the square brackets and the
        curved brackets look so similar and they are easily gazed over when
        checking code for errors.
        <br />
        I found myself looking at the code, over and over. Reading it out loud -
        even then, I still couldn't find my error. I turned to google, asking it
        why my console.log in logging 'undefined'. I saw something online about
        the bracket format and re-read my code... Duh, my brackets were in the
        wrong place. Finding that was a total lightbulb moment!
      </p>
      <h2>Elegantly solving a problem</h2>
      <p>
        I'm not sure what Elegantly means, so I used my problem solving skills
        to figure this word out. <br />
        Google says:
        <i>adjective</i>
        1. graceful and stylish in appearance or manner.<br />
        similar words: stylish, suave, swanky, smart, refined, tasteful.
        <br />
        Prehaps I'll answer this question by changing the word to tasteful - how
        did I solve a problem in a tasteful way (Googles explaintation is
        showing good judgement or appropriate behaviour) elegantly solved a
        problem. what was the problem? what problem-solving techniques did you
        use? how did you feel throughout the process? what did you learn?
