        <h1>JavaScript & DOM</h1>
        <p>
          <em>
            It's our time time explore JavaScript and the DOM and how it relates
            to HTML and CSS.
          </em>

      <h2>
        So, what is JavaScript and what is it's relationship with HTML and CSS?
      </h2>
      <p>
        HMTL defines the structure of the webpage. CSS assists with making the
        webpage look nice and appealing to look at. JavaScript provides
        interactivity that brings the webpage to life. With JavaScript you can
        provide interactivity for the user, such as; reaction to mouse clicks,
        animations for a loading page or even a fancy menu hamburger that pops
        open your Navigation links.
      </p>

      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control Flow to put it simply, is how the computer executes statements
        in a script. More often than not, a computer will execute code from the
        top to the bottom. When there are loops in the code, the computer will
        work through each one, starting at the first one before moving on to the
        second and so on and although this may sound like it may take some time
        to complete, the computer will execute your code quicker than you can
        say, <em>"Bob's you're uncle!"</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine you're meeting with 5 friends, who you haven't seen for a while
        and you need to greet them when you see them again. The way you could
        greet all 5 of your friends is through a JavaScript loop, which could
        look like this:
        <br />
        <img
          class="jsexample"
          src="../pictures/loopjs.png"
          alt="Image example of a JavaScript Loop"
        />
        <br />
        The loop in the image above will run 5 times over and each time it runs,
        it will print "Hello Friend!" to the website console.
      </p>

      <h2>The DOM</h2>

      <p>
        DOM stands for Document Object Model and it's an interface for websites.
        The DOM allows for progamming languages such as JavaScript to manipulate
        the elements of a webpage. The DOM also allows developers to test out
        how new colors or styles will look on their website before adding the
        changes into their html/css files.
      </p>
      <h2>Arrays vs. Objects</h2>
      <p>
        An array allows multiple items to be stored under a single variable
        name. When using an array, the items are counted by starting at 0. For
        example, if you have 4 items in an array and you count like a
        programmer, you would count 0 <em>(Tim)</em>, 1 <em>(Kathryn)</em>, 2
        <em>(Hannah)</em>, 3 <em>(Chris)</em>. You can access items stored in
        arrays via loops & functions. <br />
        <img
          class="jsexample"
          src="../pictures/arrayjs.png"
          alt="Image of JavaScript array"
        />
        <br />
        An object allows multiple items and data connected to those items to be
        stored in boxes. This allows you to access the data using the object
        label, for example <code>family.hannah.color</code> would access the
        data "Pink".
        <br />
        <img
          class="jsexample"
          src="../pictures/objectjs.png"
          alt="Image of JavaScript objects"
        />
      </p>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        A function is a block of code written to perform a specific task. For
        example, I want to know if I have time to read my book before bed and I
        have written a function that takes my bed time and tells me if I have
        enough time to read 10 or 5 pages, or if I need to go to bed earlier the
        next night. <br />

        <img
          class="jsexample"
          src="../pictures/functionjs.png"
          alt="Image of JavaScript Function"
        />
        <br />
        The above image shows a JavaScript function that takes the time entered
        in the "bedtime(2200)" call and it will log into the console "You have
        time to read 5 pages of your current book".
