        <!-- <h3>Kia ora</h3> -->
        <p>
          Kia ora, I'm Rebecca. I'm from a small town called
          <span style="color: #f9f7f7">Ashhurst</span>
          but I now live in Wellington and have called Wellington home for the
          past 10 years.
          <br />
          <br />I value
          <span style="color: #f9f7f7"> humour, adventure, honesty</span> and
          <span style="color: #f9f7f7">peace</span> the most at this stage in my
          life. I am always on the hunt for my next adventure, whether that is
          signing up for my next run event or putting my hand up to do something
          different in the weekend - anything can be an adventure, it's all
          about mindset.
          <br />
          <br />I decided to study with Dev Academy this year as I'm at a
          crossroads in my career - I could continue being a SDA, which I have
          been doing for five years, or I could upskill and move into a job that
          is interesting and challenges me.
          <br />
          <br />I've always been creative, whether I'm writing a blog about my
          travels or coming up with app ideas, it seems like the path that I'm
          on now will give me the tools I need to meet my creative goals.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of study/work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and
          family - sign me up for a board game night anytime. I spend a good
          chunk of my spare time exercising. I ran my
          <span style="color: #f9f7f7">first half marathon</span> last year, and
          I'm hoping to run another later this year. When I'm not running or
          playing Catan, I can be found cooking something delicious in the
          kitchen, or having a laugh on the phone with my mum or simply
          <span style="color: #f9f7f7">dreaming</span> up my
          <span style="color: #f9f7f7">next adventure</span>.

          This topic was an interesting one for me. As someone who doesn't say
          much, I haven't spent much time thinking about what my values are.
          There were plenty of light bulb moments...
